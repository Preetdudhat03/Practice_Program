Diploma Practice Codes
📌 About This Repository

This repository contains all the code I practiced during my Diploma studies.
Each program was written from scratch by me with the goal of understanding the core concepts deeply, not just copying or memorizing solutions.

🎯 Purpose

To strengthen my fundamental programming concepts

To practice writing clean and logical code

To understand how and why the code works, step by step

To build a strong foundation for advanced topics

🧠 Learning Approach

Every program is implemented from scratch

Concepts are learned through hands-on practice

Focus on:

Logic building

Problem solving

Concept clarity

Code may include basic, intermediate, and practice-level examples

🛠️ Topics Covered

(Some examples — modify as needed)

Basics of programming

Variables and data types

Conditional statements

Loops

Functions

Arrays / Strings

File handling / Data structures (if applicable)

📂 Structure

The repository is organized by topics and practice sessions for easy understanding and revision.

🚀 Note

This repository is meant for learning and practice purposes.
The focus is on conceptual understanding rather than optimized or production-level code.
